Project name: Distributed AI and Chess Variant

-Description-
A Medieval Chess variant using the expanded ruleset of corps commands which establishes the bishops and kings as commanding pieces where each player can use one action for each commanding piece per turn.
With the variation, the left bishop controls the left knight and the left three pawns, the right bishop controls the right knight and right three pawns, and the king controls the queen, both rooks, and center two pawns.
The game is built in a 3D environment using Unity. 
The project incorporates an AI controller for the opposing player which uses a distributed AI model that evaluates the best move for each corps and takes actions accordingly.
The model will follow the standard turn based rules of the game and will move the pieces to reflect its decisions based on the algorithms utilized.
